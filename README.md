## How to get this working

**NOTE**: While we are not yet out of beta, it is recommended to remove any previous sgug-rse installation before extracting this new one. We don't yet support in-place upgrades using RPMs:

```shell
# As root
rm -rf /usr/sgug/*
```

**(1)** Add your user account to the irix `sys` group - this will allow you to use the sgug `sudo` out of the box with your user password - then you can follow the steps below without additional hoop jumping.

Need help with setting up sudo? Please see our [troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting.md).



**(2)** Ensure your system can cope with long command line buffers:

```shell
# As root
su -
# Show existing value
systune ncargs
# Tweak if < 262144
systune ncargs 262144
```

**(3)** Download the artifacts for the latest version from the github releases tab (assuming they aren't too big).

You'll find three main archives:

```shell
sgug-rse-selfhoster-0.0.7beta.tar.gz
sgug-rse-localrepo-0.0.7beta.tar.gz
```

**(4)** Extract the selfhoster and local repo archives under `/usr` as root (important, sgug-rse _installation_ files are root owned and managed):

```shell
su -  #(enter root password)
cd /usr
gunzip -dc /path/to/sgug-rse-selfhoster-0.0.7beta.tar.gz | tar xf -
gunzip -dc /path/to/sgug-rse-localrepo-0.0.7beta.tar.gz | tar xf -
(log out of root)
```

**(5)** Setup SGUG environment.

The SGUG selfhoster comes with a shell called `sgugshell`, which is a wrapper for bash that sets up the correct environment to use SGUG software. You can either use this shell as-is, or set up the correct paths within the shell of your choice.

To use `sgugshell` as your login shell:

```shell
su -  #(enter root password)
# Add sgugshell to the list of login shells
echo /usr/sgug/bin/sgugshell >> /etc/shells
# Modify the last field of your entry in /etc/passwd to point to /usr/sgug/bin/sgugshell
vi /etc/passwd
(log out of root)
```

If you'd prefer to use another shell, you'll need to modify some variables to set it up properly with sgug-rse. Here's an example for tcsh:

```shell
# Expand path to include SGUG
set path = ( /usr/sgug/bin /usr/sgug/sbin $path )

# Explicit library paths
setenv LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH /usr/sgug/lib32:/usr/lib32:/lib32:/usr/lib:/lib

# Add SGUG manuals to search path
setenv MANPATH /usr/sgug/share/man:/usr/share/catman:/usr/share/man:/usr/catman:/usr/man:$HOME/man

# Work around libiconv localisation issue
setenv LC_ALL C
```

**(6)** Now you can search for and install sgug RPM packages. Note that you have to be root in order for the `tdnf` tool to work:

```shell
sudo tdnf install mpg123
```
```
Installing:
mpg123-libs                    mips            1.25.10-2.sgug       sgugrselocal    425.17k 435369
mpg123                         mips            1.25.10-2.sgug       sgugrselocal    249.11k 255085

Total installed size: 674.27k 690454

You can search for packages with:

```shell
sudo tdnf search mpg123
```
```
mpg123 : Real time MPEG 1.0/2.0/2.5 audio player/decoder for layers 1, 2 and 3
mpg123-devel : Real time MPEG 1.0/2.0/2.5 audio player/decoder for layers 1, 2 and 3
mpg123-libs : Real time MPEG 1.0/2.0/2.5 audio player/decoder for layers 1, 2 and 3
```

## (Re-)build RPMs from Source

You can rebuild any of the existing package from source, for example if you want to try out different build options. For that you need to install the source RPM archive (`sgug-rse-srpms`) in addition to the `sgug-rse-selfhoster` and `sgug-rse-localrepo`.

You want to contribute a new package to the sgug-rse repository? That's great! Please check out the [contribution guidelines](./contributing.md) for more details.

**(1)** Before you start, make sure you are in sgugshell:

```shell
/usr/sgug/bin/sgugshell
```

**(2)** Install common build tools:

```shell
sudo tdnf install wget rpm-build autoconf automake libtool gcc gcc-c++
```

**(3)** Create build directories in your user's home:

```shell
mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/SPECS
mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES
mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS
mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/RPMS
```

**(4)** Download the source RPM archive for the latest version
(`sgug-rse-srpms-x.y.z.tar.gz`) from the [Github releases tab](https://github.com/sgidevnet/sgug-rse/releases) and extract it into the build directory: 

```shell
cd /tmp
wget https://github.com/sgidevnet/sgug-rse/releases/download/v0.0.7beta/sgug-rse-srpms-0.0.7beta.tar.gz

cd ~/rpmbuild
gunzip -dc /tmp/sgug-rse-srpms-0.0.7beta.tar.gz | tar xf -
```

**(5)** To rebuild an RPM package you first have to install the SRPM of the package (in this example we will rebuild mpg123):

```shell
cd ~/rpmbuild/
rpm -ivh ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS/mpg123-1.25.10-2.sgug.src.rpm
```

You can modify the specfile locally in the `~/rpmbuild/SPECS/` directory if you want to try out different build options.
Now you can run `rpmbuild` on the package's specfile:

```shell
cd ~/rpmbuild/
rpmbuild -ba ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/mpg123.spec --nocheck
```

**(6)** After building, install of fresh RPMs must be done as root (add `--reinstall` to refresh an already installed package):

```shell
sudo rpm -ivh ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/mips/m4*.rpm
```

## Bugs

There will be bugs, I'm afraid. This platform is relatively new, much as the GCC underpinning it is. Please do file an issue for things you find - it helps a lot to double check there isn't already one for the problem you have.

Feel free to contact us on the forums or in discord and we may be able to help.

- Rebase to 2015c
  - Egypt's spring-forward transition is at 24:00 on April's last Thursday,
    not 00:00 on April's last Friday.  2015's transition will therefore be on
    Thursday, April 30 at 24:00, not Friday, April 24 at 00:00.  Similar fixes
    apply to 2026, 2037, 2043, etc.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

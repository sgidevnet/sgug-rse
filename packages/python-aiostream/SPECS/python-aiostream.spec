%description
aiostream provides a collection of stream operators that can be combined
to create asynchronous pipelines of operations.

It can be seen as an asynchronous version of itertools, although some
aspects are slightly different. Essentially, all the provided operators
return a unified interface called a stream.

A stream is an enhanced asynchronous iterable providing the following
features:

- Operator pipe-lining - using pipe symbol |
- Repeatability - every iteration creates a different iterator
- Safe iteration context - using async with and the stream method
- Simplified execution - get the last element from a stream using await
- Slicing and indexing - using square brackets []
- Concatenation - using addition symbol +

Subject: [PATCH] Remove tests that use the tarpit

The latest version of Mock has started using systemd containers. The
systemd-nspawn command is being run with --private-network, which
immediately kills connections to something other than localhost. These
tests depend on the connection not being killed immediately and that
they are never responded to.

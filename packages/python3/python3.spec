# The description used both for the SRPM and the main `python3` subpackage:
%description
Python is an accessible, high-level, dynamically typed, interpreted programming
language, designed with an emphasis on code readability.
It includes an extensive standard library, and has a vast ecosystem of
third-party libraries.

The %{name} package provides the "python3" executable: the reference
interpreter for the Python language, version 3.
The majority of its standard library is provided in the %{name}-libs package,
which should be installed automatically along with %{name}.
The remaining parts of the Python standard library are broken out into the
%{name}-tkinter and %{name}-test packages, which may need to be installed
separately.

Documentation for Python is provided in the %{name}-docs package.

Packages containing additional libraries for Python are generally named with
the "%{name}-" prefix.

# But since we want to provide versioned python, we require exact version
Provides: python = %{version}-%{release}
# This also save us an explicit conflict for older python3 builds

%description -n python-unversioned-command
This package contains /usr/sgug/bin/python - the "python" command that runs Python 3.

Recommends: %{name}%{?_isa} = %{version}-%{release}

# https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Move_usr_bin_python_into_separate_package
# In Fedora 31, several "unversioned" files like /usr/bin/pydoc and all the
# "unversioned" provides were moved from python2 to python3.
# So, newer python3 packages need to conflict with old Python 2 builds that
# still provided unversioned Python.
# Since all python packages, new and old, have versioned requires on
# python?-libs, we do it here:
Conflicts: python-libs < 3
# (We explicitly conflict with python-libs and not python2-libs, so only the
# old Python 2 builds that still provided unversioned Python are handled.)


%description libs
This package contains runtime libraries for use by Python:
- the majority of the Python standard library
- a dynamically linked library for use by applications that embed Python as
  a scripting language, and by the main "python3" executable

Conflicts: python-devel < 3

%description devel
This package contains the header files and configuration needed to compile
Python extension modules (typically written in C or C++), to embed Python
into other programs, and to make binary distributions for Python libraries.

It also contains the necessary macros to build RPM packages with Python modules
and 2to3 tool, an automatic source converter from Python 2.X.

%description idle
IDLE is Python’s Integrated Development and Learning Environment.

IDLE has the following features: Python shell window (interactive
interpreter) with colorizing of code input, output, and error messages;
multi-window text editor with multiple undo, Python colorizing,
smart indent, call tips, auto completion, and other features;
search within any window, replace within editor windows, and
search through multiple files (grep); debugger with persistent
breakpoints, stepping, and viewing of global and local namespaces;
configuration, browsers, and other dialogs.


%package tkinter

The Tkinter (Tk interface) library is a graphical user interface toolkit for
the Python programming language.

Requires: %{name} = %{version}-%{release}
Requires: %{name}-libs%{?_isa} = %{version}-%{release}

you should use the unittest module from %{name}-libs, or a library such as
%{name}-pytest or %{name}-nose.

# In Fedora 31, /usr/bin/python-debug was moved here from Python 2.
Conflicts: python-debug < 3

%{?python_provide:%python_provide python3-debug}

%description debug
python3-debug provides a version of the Python runtime with numerous debugging
features enabled, aimed at advanced Python users such as developers of Python
extension modules.

This version uses more memory and will be slower than the regular Python build,
but is useful for tracking down reference-counting issues and other bugs.

The bytecode format is unchanged, so that .pyc files are compatible between
this and the standard version of Python, but the debugging features mean that
C/C++ extension modules are ABI-incompatible and must be built for each version
separately.

The debug build shares installation directories with the standard Python
runtime, so that .py and .pyc files can be shared.
Compiled extension modules use a special ABI flag ("d") in the filename,
so extensions for both versions can co-exist in the same directory.

# executables linked against libpython3* (such as /usr/bin/python3 itself)

# These hooks are implemented in Python itself (though they are for the version
# of python that gdb is linked with)
#
# gdb-archer looks for them in the same path as the ELF file or its .debug
# file, with a -gdb.py suffix.
# We put them next to the debug file, because ldconfig would complain if
# it found non-library files directly in /usr/lib/
# (see https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=562980)
#
# We'll put these files in the debuginfo package by installing them to e.g.:
#  /usr/lib/debug/usr/lib/libpython3.2.so.1.0.debug-gdb.py
# (note that the debug path is /usr/lib/debug for both 32/64 bit)

# We put the debug-gdb.py file inside /usr/lib/debug to avoid noise from ldconfig
# See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=562980
#
# The /usr/lib/rpm/redhat/macros defines %%__debug_package to use
# debugfiles.list, and it appears that everything below /usr/lib/debug and
# (/usr/src/debug) gets added to this file (via LISTFILES) in
# /usr/lib/rpm/find-debuginfo.sh
#
# Hence by installing it below /usr/lib/debug we ensure it is added to the
# -debuginfo subpackage
# (if it doesn't, then the rpmbuild ought to fail since the debug-gdb.py
# payload file would be unpackaged)

%description
The AWS IoT Device SDK for Python allows developers to write Python script to
use their devices to access the AWS IoT platform through MQTT or MQTT over the
WebSocket protocol. By connecting their devices to AWS IoT, users can securely
work with the message broker, rules, and the device shadow (sometimes referred
to as a thing shadow) provided by AWS IoT and with other AWS services like AWS
Lambda, Amazon Kinesis, Amazon S3, and more.
